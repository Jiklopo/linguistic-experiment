# Linguistic experiment

## Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive platform designed for the execution of linguistic experiments. It encompasses two distinct types of experiments: the ABX task and the identification task.

#### ABX Task
In the ABX task, participants engage by listening to two distinct sounds. Subsequently, they are presented with a third sound and are tasked with determining its similarity to one of the initial two sounds.

#### Identification Task
The identification task involves participants listening to two different sounds initially. Following this, participants are presented with a set of stimuli, and their objective is to discern which of the first two sounds each stimulus most closely resembles.
